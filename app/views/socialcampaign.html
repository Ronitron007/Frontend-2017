	<br>
	<p><b>The Problem:</b>
<br>
Lack of sanitation facilities is one of the major problems faced by our country today. Open defecation leads to water pollution, spread of disease and loss of dignity. Our government is trying its best to tackle this issue with its “Swachh Bharat” and “Har Ghar Shouchalay” campaigns but numerous hurdles lie in the way.
We realised that the biggest hurdle in construction of toilets was the high expenditure involved.
Majority of people in need simply can’t afford building a toilet. There is a need for a construction technique that is cheap, simple, yet efficient.
Who thought the answer would lie in the thousands of bottles thrown away every day that clog our drains, fill our lakes and litter our lands… 
<p><b>The solution:</b>
<br>
The beauty of this technique lies in its simplicity.
Just fill sand in PET bottles and use them to substitute bricks and lo you are done!
The cost of bricks is directly cut down and at the same time a sink for more than 4000 bottles is created!
</p><p>
<b>It's open source, because great things always are!</b>
<br>
We can’t really make a great dent in the huge open defecation figures till we enable

everyone to build a toilet on their own.

All the technical stuff required along with a detailed methodology will be uploaded here.

So that anyone anywhere can easily build a PET bottle toilet by themselves within a couple

of days.
</p><p>
<b>How can you help?</b>
<br>
The bottles required for these toilets will be collected through multiple collection boxes in various restaurants and through several collection drives. In short, your bottles will change the world!
<br><br>
<a src="" style="cursor:pointer;">Here’s </a>the list of restaurants that have bottle collection points. Do donate your bottles there!
<br><br>
Restaurants, lodges, companies and NGOs can collaborate in the folowing manner :

<h4><b>Past campaigns:</b></h4>

<p> <b>Pledge-A-Book (2014,2015):</b> </p>
<p>Pledge-A-Book (PAB), was a unique social campaign to spread education, literacy, and multilingualism by facilitating the access of books to the underprivileged. Started in 2014, its main aim was to bridge the gap between those who have access to resources and those lacking them.</p>
<p>PAB was based on the simple yet powerful idea of mapping books that were no longer useful to the current owners, to underprivileged students. </p>
<p>Building on the success of the first edition, PAB was scaled up to a national level in 2015 by expanding on-ground as well as online presence.</p><br>

<p> <b>Highlights:</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>We broadened our reach to <b>3 other cities</b> (Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Pune) and collected over <b>15,000 books</b> of which every book was mapped in our database.</li>

<li><b>15 libraries</b> were set up in and around Chennai.
</li>
<li>
An online portal was set up to link all the stakeholders.
</li>
<li>
Associations with 20+ NGOs, 10+ schools and more than 5 franchise associations like Crossword, Shell, Just Buy Cycles, etc. enabled a large number of people to donate books.

</li>
<li>

<b>Limca Book Of Record:</b> This record involved collection of about <b>12,000</b> customized Pledge-A-Book bookmarks from students of over <b>10 Kendriya Vidyalaya Schools</b> within a span of 2 hours.

</li>
<li>
The campaign got support from celebrities like Sachin Tendulkar, Raghuram Rajan, Dalai Lama, Chetan Bhagat, R Ashwin, Kanan Gill, Kenny Sebastian, Abish Mathew, Akshar Patel, Stuart Binny, Rashmi Bansal, Saba Karim to name a few.

</li>

</ul>

<p>The libraries that we set up are fully functional today and are doing their bit to curb illiteracy, one library at a time.
</p> 
<p>We, at Shaastra are proud to be a socially responsible fest and we hope to take this legacy forward in 2017 through SYNK.</p>
